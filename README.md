Fullstack typescript-node-js,typescript-react app interfacing with a public API. 

In particular the app consists on an Express server running schema validation on a nested JSON object, and a frontend form which generates the nested JSON object to send to the backend.

This app demonstrates my technical skills and best practices in:
- writing clean code
- separating concerns
- state management
- writing unit + integration tests
- repository architecture for extensible industry-level projects
 
To start the application, run the following command in the root folder:

``` cd /backend & yarn install & cd /frontend & yarn install yarn dev ```
