Fullstack typescript-node-js,typescript-react app interfacing with a public API. 

This app demonstrates my technical skills and best practices I'm trying to commit to in writing clean code, separating concerns, writing unit + integration tests, and repository architecture. 
To start the application, run the following command in the root folder:
``` cd /backend & yarn install & cd /frontend & yarn install yarn dev ```
